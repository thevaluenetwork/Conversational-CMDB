# Introduction
The ServiceNow AI Platform, formerly known as the Now Platform, is more than just a System of Record for IT organizations but one challenge persistently remains: creating and maintaining a high quality Configuration Management Database (CMDB). The enterprise IT landscape is experiencing an unprecedented transformation, driven by rapid cloud (private and public) adoption, the proliferation of IoT devices, and most recently the exponential growth of agentic AI. At first glance, ServiceNow provides their customers with a standard toolbox of capabilities to achieve their CMDB aspirations and although the issues in each organization will vary slightly, success typically hangs in the balance when it comes to the coordination and consensus achieved among the various stakeholders within the IT organization (including Cybersecurity Teams as well). In full transparency, with the rebranding of the Now Platform, where most ServiceNow customers are in their overall consumption journey and where ServiceNow is going within the ServiceNow AI Platform visionary context has simply never been wider - exaserbating the organizational challenges related to ServiceNow becoming a strategic asset in the Age of AI.

Most organizational leaders just simply want the CMDB to be "done", not realizing that it is NOT a one-time project but rather a product that changes as the organization changes.

# Organizational Challenge
The monolithic nature of a CMDB is also unable to be "everything to everyone", preventing the CMDB Manager and Platform Architecture & Support Team from catering to the diverse, context-specific needs of the various stakeholders (e.g., CISOs, SecOps, Data Science teams, AI agents, etc.), which creates significant roadblocks to business agility and executing at the speed of modern business. The time-to-value for critical IT and AI initiatives is also unacceptably long. Traditional CMDBs are failing most stakeholders given that data quality is plagued by stale, inaccurate, and incomplete information. This "data crisis" makes the CMDB an untrustworthy foundation for critical IT and security operations. The operational consequences are severe: slowed incident response, increased organizational risk, wasted time as resources question data validity, and a fundamental barrier to effective AI coordination and task automation.

# The Vision (Solution)
The Conversational CMDB, a visionary AI-driven solution designed to not only solve the looming data crisis but also enable a “talk to your data” interface and as a result, provide a trustworthy data source for AI agents. It also introduces a paradigm shift from a static, one-size-fits-all CMDB to a dynamic, intelligent, and federated ecosystem by introducing multiple organizing principles. This new solution will leverage bespoke Knowledge Graphs (KGs), advanced AI agents for sense-making and intelligent ingestion, and an intent-driven, conversational interface to provide a context-rich understanding of complicated IT environments. In many ways, the structured data within the CMDB needs to be the foundation for the plethora of unstructured data that provides additional context to the overall environment. The solution will transform the CMDB from a passive, problematic database into a dynamic, federated, and intelligent data ecosystem. By creating a unified "golden record" for all assets, structuring it within a flexible knowledge graph, and layering a conversational AI interface on top, resulting in the democratization of data access, heal the underlying CMDB, and enable a shift from reactive problem-solving to proactive, predictive, and resilient IT operations.

# Common Service Data Model (CSDM)
If the previous challenges were not significant enough, the ServiceNow Common Service Data Model (CSDM) is a blessing and a curse that also needs to be addressed via an agentic AI construct. All too often the ServiceNow Team seeks the participation of the Infrastructure Operations Team to gain consensus on the adoption of the CSDM, only to slowly realize that the Ops Teams rarely care about the data model - largely because most of the Ops Team members don't see ServiceNow as "their" solution within the System of Record or single source of truth context. Many Ops Teams to too busy doing their day-to-day tasks and just simply want the ServiceNow Team members to do what is necessary to use their Configuration Items in Incident, Problem, and Change practices. This is where AI as Coordination could be instrumental in making sense of the data already being generated off platform, coming into ServiceNow via integrations, and organically created on platform. Add in operational process documentation and AI as Coordination can orchestrate value rather than just automate tasks faster, cheaper, better than their human counterparts. Coodination of the CSDM domains and the adoption itself is also possible, driving better outcomes without requiring the consensus that humans often attempt to obtain without much longer term success.

# Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT) Pipeline
Leveraging the Google Cloud Platform's BigQuery enterprise data warehouse capabilities, The Value Network LLC has been working on a design to export critical data not just from the CMDB tables but also from the non-CMDB table structure that makes up the Now Platform. Everything accessible by a ServiceNow customer is stored within a table, everything. Data that Developers interact with and configure or customize is stored within a default or custom table. Extracting the tables and records begins the "digital twin" creation process, especially once the CI relationships that make the CMDB a relational, hierarchical database are extracted and represented (transformed) within a Knowledge Graph. The data can also be kept up to date by BigQuery monitoring when the tables are changed. For customers who struggle with data quality in their CMDB, BigQuery could also export data from the Operational Teams solutions via APIs, allowing the data to be aggregated and managed via modern data science and algorithms. Doing so then opens up the possibility of then importing the critical CMDB data into ServiceNow for a rapid infusion of high quality data related to CIs and their corresponding relationships.

Note: For customers that have a high quality CMDB, the Conversational CMDB could simply be a way to enhance their Continuous Improvement efforts and overall Operational Excellence goals. The overall design could be modified to leverage an existing enterprise data warehouse, including the subsequent and appropriate knowledge graph component.

# Use Cases
- Augment future ServiceNow engagements by representing the platform’s current state within a knowledge graph.
- “Talking to the data" through natural language queries, unlocking real-time insights from historical configurations on the ServiceNow Al Platform.
- Assist Al agents (trained on ServiceNow/JavaScript) in developing features, using KG context for agile user stories without disrupting (breaking) existing configurations and workflows.
- Rapidly and holistically improve the Configuration Management Database (CMDB).
- Provide CMDB stakeholders a graph-based tool to coordinate Common Service Data Model (CSDM) adoption and daily activities, visualizing relationships across domains.

# Data Sovereignty
It is critical to support ServiceNow customer's data sovereignty requirements, meaning that the primary functions of this AI-enabled solution will be deployed within the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), however; the solution may also need to be ported to other major cloud providers, like AWS and Azure, or even within a private cloud scenario to be in compliance with a customer's requirement to keep the data within their approved cloud environment and boundary. The good news is that most enterprise data warehouse solutions have comparable capabilities along with access to deploy any supported or chosen Knowledge Graph Database. The agentic AI options that follow and emerge will need to be addressed from a data sovereignty perspective but may not be cloud provider agnostic.
